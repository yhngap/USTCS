						<h3 
style="margin-top:20px">Guidelines &amp; Regulations:</h3>
						<p>It is your responsibility 
to make sure that you adhere to the following regulations. Failure to do so 
may lead to your exam being voided.
						</p>
						<ol>
	<li>First, join the meeting using your UST account connected to 
Zoom. Make sure that you join the meeting 15 minutes before the exam 
time to make sure that your configuration works fine.</li>
	<li>You must use <span style="color:red; text-decoration:underline; 
font-weight:bold">two different devices</span> as follows:
		<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
		<li>A laptop/desktop that you will use to connect to 
Canvas and take the exam. <br/> Note:</li>
		<ul>
		  <li>The tablet/mobile version of 
Canvas does not always function properly with Canvas quizzes.</li>
		  <li>Chrome or Firefox is preferred.
		  </li>
		  <li>If you use Safari 13.1 on Mac, disable cross-site tracking or you might not be able to view images in questions.</li>
		  <li>Update your preferred Web browser to the latest version.</li>
		  <li>If you are having any other issues, you may try to clear the cache.</li>
		</ul>
		<li>Another device (mobile phone/tablet/laptop/desktop) 
that you will use to join the Zoom meeting.</li>
		</ol>
	</li>
	<li>Device (b) must have video and audio capabilities and you must 
make sure that its camera clearly shows your face (at least partially), 
your hands, and desk area 
so that we can make sure you are working on the Canvas exam on your own. 
The screen of device (a) (i.e. the device where you are taking the Canvas 
exam) must also be visible. However, the camera does not need to show 
your exam input but just show enough to demonstrate that the <span 
style="color:blue">only 
active window is Canvas</span>. See <a href="img/exam-setup.png">here</a> 
for an example 
of "correct" configuration.</li>
	<li>If you have your camera turned off or not correctly configured, 
you <span style="color:red">will not be allowed to take the exam 
and there will not be any make-up exam for you.</span>
	<li>You are NOT allowed to access any other programs, applications, 
browser tabs, or windows on device (a), except for the Canvas window for 
taking the exam. Keep in mind that Canvas tracks when you switch to a 
different window, application, or tab and we will check this.</li>
	<li>While taking the exam, you must be alone in the room and no one 
else should be with you. If you are unable to have access to such a room, 
then you must inform the instructor of this at least two days before the 
exam, explain why this is not possible and state who else might be in the 
room with you during the exam.</li>
	<li>During the exam, you may be asked to adjust your camera if it 
is not well-placed or to show that you are the only person in the room so 
make sure that you <span style="color:blue">have audio 
turned on in device 
(b)</span>, but <span style="color:blue">don't put on your 
earphones or 
headsets</span>. 
During 
the exam, you 
must remain silent and are not allowed to communicate verbally, 
electronically or in any other way with anyone, except for the 
invigilator.</li>
	<li>If you have a question about the exam, you may 
click "raise hand" button. Then, the invigilator would take 
you to a breakout room and address the question through 
verbal communications.
<!--you may use the chat 
function of Zoom to communicate your question privately to the 
invigilator.--></li>
	<li>Have your HKUST student ID and HKID / passport ready at any time. You will be moved to a breakout room along to show your IDs.</li>
	<li>You are allowed to have blank sheets of paper that you will use 
for rough work.</li>
