              <h4>How to Play?</h4>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  The Player and the Computer both start with maximum HEALTH and no CHARGE.
                </li>
                <li>
                  In each round, the Player and the Computer simultaneously choose one of the following actions:
                  <ul>
                    <li>
                      ATTACK: 
					  <ul>
						<li>Decreases opponent's HEALTH with DAMAGE depending on one's CHARGE.</li>
						<li>Consumes all of one's CHARGE if any (reset to 0).</li> 
						<li>Interrupts if opponent is CHARGING (reset opponent's CHARGE to 0).</li>
					  </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      DEFEND: 
					  <ul>
						<li>Reduces DAMAGE from opponent's ATTACK.</li>
						<li>Possibly NULLIFYING or even REFLECTING DAMAGE.</li>
						<li>Protects against being interrupted and preserves CHARGE.</li>
					  </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      CHARGE: 
					  <ul>
						<li>Increases one's CHARGE by 1, empowering a future ATTACK.</li>
						<li>Can be interrupted if the opponent ATTACKS at the same time.</li>
						<li>CHARGE count is preserved when DEFENDING.</li>
					  </ul>
                    </li>
                  </ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                  The game ends when someone's HEALTH reaches 0, and the winner is the one with non-zero HEALTH. 
				  If both the Player's and the Computer's HEALTH reach 0 simultaneously, the game ends in a tie.

              <h4>Letting the Computer Play</h4>
              <p class="card-text">
                In order to keep the game dynamic and unpredictable, the computer opponent will choose its actions randomly. You need not to worry on coding this as it is already done for you in the skeleton code. However, it is useful for you to be aware of random number generators.
              </p>
              <p class="card-text">
                Random number generators (RNGs) generate sequences of numbers which have the desired properties of randomness. Since generating truly random numbers is relatively costly, a class of RNGs called pseudo-random number generators (PRNGs) output numbers which have the desired properties without being truly random. Typically, PRNGs are composed of an internal state and an algorithm which generates the next pseudo-random number according to the internal state and which also updates the current internal state. Hence, the non-deterministic property of a PRNG mainly relies on not knowing its internal state and its algorithm. On the other hand, if the internal state can be set, we can return to a previous internal state in order to repeat the sequence of numbers generated. This property is useful for replicating experiments with PRNGs, and thus, most technical reports include the random seed which is the number programmers used to set the initial internal state.
              </p>
			  <p class="card-text">
			  For our lab, it is easier to debug and also to perform automated grading if we can fix the seed and know the pseudo-random sequence beforehand. 
			For other use cases where this is undesirable, usually an easy solution is to use the current time as the seed, which is always incrementing (and thus always changing). 
			You may have rarely received an error with HKUST's Duo 2FA system with the message of "failed to synchronize with time server" or something similar. 
			More advanced random number generation systems are typically used in security and cryptography applications, such as financial authentication systems.
			  </p>
              <p class="card-text">
                For simple use cases, usually the PRNG used in C++ is the <code>srand()</code> and <code>rand()</code> functions in the <code>cstdlib</code> library, which must be imported or included at the beginning of the program. 
	      The following is a code example:</p> 
	      <pre class="prettyprint">
#include &lt;iostream&gt; // For cout
#include &lt;cstdlib&gt;  // For srand, rand
#include &lt;ctime&gt;    // For time
using namespace std;

int main() {
  /*
     srand is a function used to initialize the pseudo-random number generator.
     An unsigned int is a parameter being used to generate a sequence of integers.
     We call it a seed.

     In the following statement,
     - time(nullptr) returns the current time of the system in number of seconds elapsed
       since Jan 1, 1970 and is used as the seed to generate the sequence.
  */
  srand(static_cast&lt;unsigned int&gt;(time(nullptr)));

  /*
     In each iteration, get the next number in the sequence, make it in the range 0 to 9
     and print it on screen.
  */
  for(int i=0; i<10; ++i) {
    cout << rand() % 10 << ( (i != 9) ? " " : "\n" );
  }

  // Question: Check the following code and see what you observe.

  srand(100);
  for(int i=0; i<5; ++i) {
    cout << rand() % 10 << ( (i != 4) ? " " : "\n" );
  }

  srand(100);
  for(int i=0; i<5; ++i) {
    cout << rand() % 10 << ( (i != 4) ? " " : "\n" );
  }

  return 0;
}
	      </pre>
		  <br/>
		  <p class="card-text">
			However, for this lab we are using our own custom PRNG implementation, in order to ensure consistency for automated grading. 
			Please do not modify the PRNG code blocks in the skeleton code, otherwise you may break the automated grading pipeline and result in a false "0" grade. <br/>
			<br/>
			The <code>"Choose Computer Player (0-100): "</code> portion of the code asks the player for an integer input between 0-100 to be the seed of our PRNG. 
			As explained above, reusing the same seed will produce the same sequence of pseudo-random numbers across multiple runs of the game. 
			 <br/>
			<br/>
			Here is what the code looks like, though it is unnecessary for you to understand it when coding the lab tasks.

              <p class="card-text">
                Update <code>player_charge</code> and <code>computer_charge</code> according to the following rules:
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    If one ATTACKS, one loses all CHARGE.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    If one CHARGES and the opponent ATTACKS, one's CHARGING is INTERRUPTED and one's CHARGE resets.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    If one CHARGES and the opponent does not ATTACK, one's CHARGE increments.
                  </li>
                </ul>
                Announce INTERRUPTED CHARGING whenever it occurs.
              </p>
              <br>
              <h4>Task 4 - Update Player's HEALTH and Computer's HEALTH</h4>
              <p class="card-text">
                Update <code>player_damage</code> and <code>computer_damage</code>.<br/>
				Cap DAMAGE received to current HEALTH (no overkill).<br/>
				Announce <code>player_damage</code> (only if non-zero) and update <code>player_health</code>.<br/>
				Similarly, announce <code>computer_damage</code> (only if non-zero) and update </code>computer_health</code>.
              </p>
              <br>
              <h4>Task 5 - Check for winner</h4>
              <p class="card-text">
                Set <code>winner</code> to 1 if the Player wins, 2 if the Computer wins, and 3 for a tie.<br/>
				One wins if the opponent's HEALTH reaches 0.<br/>
				A tie occurs if both HEALTHs simultaneously reach 0.
              </p>
