						<ol>
	<li>The Examination consists of <span 
style="color:blue">multiple-choice 
and essay type questions. Multiple choice questions may have more than one answer</span>. 
Partial credits may be given to correct answers of multiple choice questions only if no incorrect answer is selected. </li>
                            <li>The examination will be split into three sessions, each lasts about 50 minutes. The sessions will be shown on screen <span 
style="color:blue">one-at-a-time</span>. When a session has ended, no further changes to your answers in this session are allowed. Manage your pace accordingly so that you do not run out of 
time. The session ends once you have submitted your answers in that session.</li>
	<li>The whole examination is scheduled to last for <span 
style="color:blue">3 hours</span> between 16:30 and 19:30.</li>
    <li>There will be a short break between the sessions. Please use the washroom during the breaks if needed. Leaving for washroom after a session has started will not be accommodated except for strong reasons. During the breaks, student IDs will be checked in the Zoom breakout room. Please bring your student ID card before examination. Please keep your devices (a) and (b) connected to Canvas and Zoom, respectively, throughout the whole examination (including breaks).</li>
	<li>The Examination will be conducted on 
Canvas. Access codes for the three examination sessions will be released over Zoom at the beginning of each session at 16:30, 17:30 and 18:30, respectively, unless otherwise announced during the examination.</li>
	<li>The Examination will be proctored via a Zoom meeting (see 
guidelines below) which <span style="color:blue">will be recorded</span>. In 
order to take the examination, <span style="color:blue">you 
must be logged in</span> to the Zoom meeting with video camera turned on. Students are divided into logged in three different Zoom meetings. Make sure that you attend the assigned Zoom meeting; otherwise 10 points will be deduced. Access code of the examination questions will be given in the Zoom meeting at the start of each part in the examination. Your participation in a session will not be counted if you fail to turn on your Zoom video camera showing that you are working only on Canvas throughout the session.</li>

style="margin-top:20px">Guidelines &amp; Regulations:</h3>
						<p>It is your responsibility 
to make sure that you adhere to the following regulations. Failure to do so 
may lead to your Examination being voided.
						</p>
						<ol>
	<li>First, join the meeting using your UST account connected to Zoom. Make sure that you join the meeting 20 minutes before the Examination time to make sure that your configuration works fine before examination starts.</li>
	<li>You must be alone in your room while taking the Examination, and no one 
else should be with you. If you are unable to have access to such a room, 
you must inform the instructor of this at least a week before the 
Examination, explain why this is not possible and state who else might be in the 
room with you during the Examination.</li>
	<li>You must use <span style="color:red; text-decoration:underline; 
font-weight:bold">two different devices</span> as follows:
		<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
		<li>A laptop/desktop that you will use to connect to 
Canvas and take the Examination. <br/> Note:</li>
		<ul>
		  <li>The tablet/mobile version of 
Canvas does not always work properly with Canvas Quiz function, by which the online examination will be conducted.</li>
		  <li>Chrome or Firefox is preferred.
		  </li>
		  <li>If you use Safari 13.1 on Mac, disable cross-site tracking or you might not be able to view images in questions.</li>
		  <li>Update your preferred Web browser to the latest version.</li>
		  <li>If you are having any other issues, you may try to clear the cache.</li>
		</ul>
		<li>Another device (mobile phone/tablet/laptop/desktop) 
that you will use to join the Zoom meeting.</li>
		</ol>
	</li>
	<li>Device (b) must have video and audio capabilities and you must 
make sure that its camera clearly shows your face (at least partially), 
your hands, and desk area 
        (including keyboard and mouse/touchpad) so that we can make sure you are working on the Canvas Examination on your own. 
        The screen of device (a) (i.e. the device where you are taking the Canvas 
Examination) must also be visible. However, the camera does not need to show 
your examination input but just show enough to demonstrate that the <span 
style="color:blue">only 
active window is Canvas</span>. See <a href="instructions/img/midterm-setup.png">here</a> 
for an example 
of "correct" configuration.</li>
	<li>If you have your camera turned off or not correctly configured, 
you <span style="color:red">will not be allowed to take the Examination 
and there will not be any make-up Examination for you.</span>
	<li>During the Examination, you may be asked to adjust your camera if it 
is not well-placed or to show that you are the only person in the room so 
make sure that you <span style="color:blue">have the audio working in device 
(b)</span>, but <span style="color:blue">don't put on your 
earphones or 
headsets</span>. You need to turn on the speaker of device (b) for our communication with you during the examination. Please find a quiet place to take the examination.
        We may turn on your audio devices for communication if needed. During 
the examination, you 
must remain silent and are not allowed to communicate verbally, 
electronically or in any other way with anyone, except for the 
invigilators.</li>
	<li>You are NOT allowed to access any other programs, applications, 
browser tabs, or windows on devices (a) and (b), except for the Canvas window for 
taking the examination on device (a) and the Zoom for monitoring and communication on device (b) during the examination. Keep in mind that Canvas tracks when you switch to a 
different window, application, or tab and we will check this.</li>
	<li>If you have a question about the examination, you may 
click "raise hand" button. Then, an invigilator would take 
you to a breakout room and address the question through 
verbal communications. <!--you may use the chat 
function of Zoom to communicate your question privately to the 
invigilator.--></li>
	<li>Have your HKUST student ID and HKID / passport ready at any time. You will be moved to a breakout room along to show your IDs.</li>
	<li>You are allowed to have blank sheets of paper that you will use 
for rough work. It is an o<span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: &quot;Helvetica Neue&quot;, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; font-style: normal; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; font-weight: 400; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: left; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255); text-decoration-style: initial; text-decoration-color: initial; display: inline !important; float: none;">pen notes (restricted to hard copies of course notes) examination. During examination, you cannot try out the questions or your answers using any electronic devices.</span></li>
                            <li>Be careful of using the &quot;tab&quot; key in typing programs at Canvas. The &quot;tab&quot; key forwards you to the next widget, which may be the &quot;Submit&quot; button. Use &quot;space&quot; instead of &quot;tab&quot;.</li>
                            <li>As advised by CEI, avoid participating in the examination with multiple browsers/multiple tabs (it may cause errors).</li>
                            <li>There is a timer showing on your Canvas screen. The timer will not pause if you exit the test. When time is up, the current examination session will automatically end. ALL SELECTED ANSWERS will be frozen and auto submitted.</li>
                            <li>Before you enter code to answer essay type questions, switch to pre-formatted text by clicking on the Paragraph option followed by Preformatted on the top right hand corner of the answer box. This will help you better format your written code.</li>
