            <p>This is a Makefile project. Just do what you did in <a href="../../labs/lab1/index.html">lab 1</a> to put that in your VS Code / Eclipse / other IDEs.<br><br>In VS Code terminal, running <code>make</code> will create 10 excuteables: test1.exe, test2.exe, ..., test10.exe for the 10 given test cases which are compiled from their corresponding mainN.cpp file, where N is the test case number, together with Inventory.cpp and Item.cpp. Run <code>./testN.exe</code> to run the program.</p> See the <a href="index.html#sample-output">Sample Output and Grading Scheme</a> section for more information about the test cases.


           <!--  <p>
            For VS Code, basically just follow <a href="https://course.cse.ust.hk/comp2011/labs/vscode/#terminal">creating a project and using the terminal for custom compilation command</a> section on our VS Code usage tutorial. That is, create a folder to hold all the extracted files in your file explorer, then open this folder in VS Code. You can then use the terminal command <code>g++ -std=c++11 *.cpp -o programName.exe</code> to compile all sources in the folder to the program, and <code>./programName</code> to run it afterward.
            </p>
            <p>
              For Eclipse: create a standard Eclipse C++ project (MinGW gcc compiler on Windows, or MacOS gcc on Mac) and add all files from the zip package to it.

          <div class="card-body" id="format">
            <h3 class="card-title">Output format</h3>
            
            <p>In <code>Inventory::print()</code>, you need to follow this format exactly for printing the inventory and the items in it. You should not have any other console output in any other functions that you implement. If you are not sure about the format, check the sample output, or simply try your implementation on the online autograder (feel free to try as the number of submissions is not limited; we only use your last submission for grading at the end).</p>
            <p>The format is as follows:</p>
            <pre>{"[FIRST ITEM NAME]":[FIRST ITEM QUANTITY],"[SECOND ITEM NAME]":[SECOND ITEM QUANTITY],"[THIRD ITEM NAME]":[THIRD ITEM QUANTITY],"[FORTH ITEM NAME]":[FORTH ITEM QUANTITY]<font color="green"> AND SO ON...</font>}</pre>
            <p>Basically, use { and } to contain all items which are separated by a single comma. Each item is represented by a quoted name, followed by a colon, followed by its quantity.</p>
            <p>At the very end after }, there is a single endl.</p>
            <p>For example, if we have 10 apples, 20 bananas, and 15 oranges, the print function should print the following line:</p>
              <pre>{"Apple":10,"Banana":20,"Orange":15}</pre>
            <p>Tips: the double quote character in C++ has to be escaped, i.e., <code>"\""</code> represents a double quote string while <code>"""</code> is incorrect.</p>

            <p>Test 10 is actually the overall test, while tests 1 to 9 are simply pieces of it. Tests 1 to 9 are there to give you partial credits. You can test all these 10 given test cases on Zinc anytime.</p>
<p>
  Your finished program should produce the exact same output as our <a href="sample.zip">sample output</a>. Please note that sample output, naturally, does not show all possible cases. It is part of the assessment for you to design your own test cases to test your program. <b>Be reminded to remove any debugging message</b> that you might have added before submitting your code.
</p>
<!-- <p>You may want to use some difference checker such as <a href="https://www.diffchecker.com/">this</a> to compare your output with the sample output since the sample output is pretty long.</p>
<p>
  Also, after testing, <b>make sure your submitted code can compile with the unmodified main.cpp and header files that are not supposed to be modified</b>. Put in dummy/empty implementation whenever needed.
</p> -->
<p>Your program should terminate without any memory leak. We will have 2 test cases (test case 9 and test case 10) to check for it. Your program will need to have 0 memory leak as well as correct output in order to get credits for test 9 and test 10. We don't care about memory leak in other test cases.</p>

<p>Each of the test cases is worth 4 marks, and there is no partial credit for each case. We will have other additional 15 test cases which are not released to you before the deadline. In total, all 25 test cases (10 given + 15 hidden) will contribute to the 100 total marks of the assignment.</p>

                 <h4 id="virtual_barn">Compilation Requirement</h4>

      <p>
        It is <strong>required</strong> that your submissions can be compiled and run successfully in our online autograder Zinc. If we cannot even compile your work, it won't be graded. Therefore, for parts that you cannot finish, just put in dummy implementation so that your whole program can be compiled for Zinc to grade the other parts that you have done. Empty implementations can be like:
      </p>
      <pre><code class="language-cpp">int SomeClass::SomeFunctionThatIsTooDifficultToImplementForMe()
{
    return 0;
}

void SomeClass::AnotherFunctionThatIsTooDifficultToImplementForMeOhNo()
{
}</code></pre>
	    <br/>
            <p>
              <h4>Late submission policy</h4>
            </p>

            <p>There will be a penalty of -1 point (out of a maximum 100 points) for
              every minute you are late. For instance, since the deadline of the assignment is 23:59:00 on Oct 13th,
              if you submit your solution at 1:00:00 on Oct 14th, there will be a penalty of -61 points for your
              assignment. However, the lowest grade you may get from
              an assignment is zero: any negative score after the deduction due to late penalty (and any other
              penalties) will be reset to zero.</p>

              <h4>Frequently Asked Questions</h4>
            </p>
	    <br/>
            <p>Q: My code doesn't work / there is an error, here is the code, can you help me fix it?</p>
            <p>A: As the assignment is a major course assessment, to be fair, you are supposed to work on it on your own and we should not finish the tasks for you. We might provide some very general hints to you, but we shall not fix the problem or debug for you.</p>
<br>
            <p>Q: Can I add extra helper functions?</p>
            <p>A: You may do so in the files that you are allowed to modify and submit.</p>
<br>
            <p>Q: Can I include additional libraries?</p>
            <p>A: No. Everything you need is already included - there is no need for you to add any include statement (under our official environment).</p>
<br>
            <p>Q: Can I use global variable or static variable such as "static int x"?</p>
            <p>A: No.</p>
<br>
            <p>Q: Can I use "auto"?</p>
            <p>A: No.</p>
<br>
            <p>Q: Do I need to keep negative quantities in an inventory? For example, we may have some negative quantities in the result of getDifference?</p>
            <p>A: No. We should not have negative quantities in an inventory. Just like the sample output, for getDifference, if (item quantity in this - item quantity in another) is negative or 0, just remove the item from the result altogether.</p>
<br>
            <p>Q: What is the difference between the destructor ~Inventory and the function emptyInventory?</p>
            <p>A: They both need to delete all the items, tho technically emptyInventory should do more than just deleting the items (e.g. setting itemCount to 0). That's why we said "you can make use of emptyInventory here" in the destructor. Also note that, destructor is a special function that is automatically invoked when an Inventory obejct is destructed. Destructors are not supposed to to be invoked manually in general. On the other hand, emptyInventory is an ordinary function which must be invoked manually, and you are free to invoke it any number of times. You can see we used emptyInventory in some of our test cases.</p>
