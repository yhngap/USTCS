                        make sure you understand what is considered as plagiarism and what the penalties are. The
                        following are
                        some of the highlights:</p>

                        <li>Do NOT try your "luck" - we use some sophisticated plagiarism detection software to find
                            cheaters. It
                            is much better than most students think. It has been proven times and times again tricks
                            don't work.
                            We also review codes for potential cases manually.

                            - it
                            is much more than that. It is simply not worth to cheat at all. You would hurt your friend

                            by doing that. It is obvious that a real friend won't ask you to get involved in a

                            any way due to the consequences. Read the Honor Code again before you even try to think

                    <p class="card-text">
                    <p>In this assignment, you are going to implement a
                        mini Library System, which allows library
                        users to search for books (Library Item).</p>

                    <p>There are 6 classes / class templates / struct.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><b>LibraryItem</b>: The base class of any borrowable item in the library.</li>
                        <li><b>Book</b>: Inherits from LibraryItem, which has an extra property physical location.</li>
                        <li><b>BST</b>: A binary search tree.</li>
                        <li><b>BSTNode</b>: A node in a BST. It is defined and implemented in BST.</li>
                        <li><b>HashTable</b>: A customizable hash table. Open addressing and lazy deletion are always
                            used (see lecture notes). However, the collision resolution strategy is customizable.
                        </li>

                        <li><b>Library</b>:
                            A library. It allows users to add a new item into the libraryItemArray. The item will
                            hash into the hash table entry with the key as name and value as LibraryItem pointer. Also,
                            it will insert into the binary search tree via key as publishing date and value as
                            LibraryItem pointer. The reason for establishing indexing is to provide fast retrieval or
                            search for library items. Library uses the hashTableIndex to store all the item pointer
                            addresses. Then, the user can search the item by the exact name.
                            Moreover, bstIndex stores the address of the item ordered by publishing day. Users can use
                            the bstIndex to search the item's pointer address by publishing date or search list of items
                            by start publishing date (inclusive) and end publishing date (inclusive). Also, the library
                            provides
                            services to borrow or return an item to the library. P.S. Since libraryItemArray,
                            hashTableIndex, bstIndex are all storing the same set of LibraryItem pointer addresses.
                            Thus, you <b>only need to release the memory once !!</b>. Therefore, hashTable has a
                            parameter called isReferenceOnly. It aims to prevent the deallocation
                            of object.
                            Finally, you can iterate via the libraryItemArray to deallocate the
                            libraryItem memory once.
                            Then, you do not need to conduct other extra operations in the Library destruction function.
                            Please don't deallocate an object's memory twice. It will probably pop up an error message
                            and terminate your program.
                        </li>

                    </ul>
                    <p>Your solution to this assignment must be based on the given skeleton code provided in the
                        Download section.</p>
                    <p>Your task is to complete the following:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><b>BSTImplementation.h</b></li>
                        <li><b>HashTableImplementation.h</b></li>
                        <li><b>Library.cpp</b></li>
                    </ul>
                    </p>
                    <p><b>Suggestion</b>: You can work in this order (one by one with the test cases):
                        BSTImplementation.h, HashTableImplementation.h, Library.cpp.</p>
                    <p>
                        You need to implement those missing functions according to specification
                        in the header files which are
                        BST.h, HashTable.h and Library.cpp. You also need to read LibraryItem, Book related files.
                        <b>These are the only 3 files you are supposed to modify, zip, and then submit to Zinc.</b>
                    </p>
                    <br/>

                    <h4>Assumption</h4>
                    <p>
                        LibraryItem/Book names are unique. Also, there is only at most one book publishing every day.
                        Thus, all the names and publishing dates are unique.
                    </p>

                    <p>Comments in the corresponding header files list out the detailed requirements. The description
                        below supplements the only missing information. You need to read both the source/header files
                        and the webpage description carefully to get the whole picture.</p>

                    <p>While you probably will jump back and forth as you read the materials as they reference each
                        other, we recommend the following general reading order:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><b>BSTNode.h</b></li>
                        <li><b>BST.h</b></li>
                        <li><b>BSTImplementation.h</b></li>
                        <li><b>HashTable.h</b></li>
                        <li><b>HashTableImplementation.h</b></li>
                        <li><b>LibraryItem.h</b></li>
                        <li><b>Book.h</b></li>
                        <li><b>Library.h</b></li>
                        <li><b>Library.cpp</b></li>
                        <li><b>main*.cpp (different test cases)</b></li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>Read the FAQ &amp; Clarifications section for some common clarifications. You should check that a
                        day before the deadline to make sure you don't miss any clarification, even if you have already
                        submitted your work then.</p>

                    <p>
                        <b>Optional Info (not related to assignment implementation)</b> : Hash Table allows O(1) access
                        of an Item via the exact key.
                        <b>HashTable</b> is suitable for <b>primary keys (unique id) lookups</b>. It allows the user to
                        retrieve an item by a key.
                        <b>BSTIndices</b> are suitable to <b>Range Queries/Scan</b> and
                        HashTable provides O(1) lookup. However, HashTable is not suitable for doing a range search.
                        Since the nature of HashTable make the item spread into a different portion of the array. Binary
                        Search Tree is more suitable to do range. They have different advantages in different use cases.

                    <p class="card-text">
                    <p>There is a private member <code>loadLimit</code> that determines when rehashing needs to happen.
                        If adding a new item to the HashTable would result in exceeding the load factor (size of table *
                        load limit fraction) (i.e. active cells, rehashing will need to be performed first, before
                        adding the new item. </p>
                    <p>To perform rehashing, you need to create a new hash table of twice the
                        size of the current hash table, and insert the items in the current hash
                        table to the new hash table. The cell
                        statuses of the cells in the new hash table (expanded table) will be
                        either ACTIVE or EMPTY.
                    </p>
                    <p>The insertion order of the items to the new table is the same as their appearance order in the
                        old/original <code>table</code> Cell array (i.e. iterate from first element in array till the
                        last element; rfrom index 0, index 1, index 2, ...)
                    <p>For simplicity, you may assume the addition of items back to the expanded table will always be
                        successful.</p>
                    <p>The following example also appears in the provided main08.cpp . You may check its code and the
                        corresponding sample output.</p>
                    <p>Suppose we have a hash table that stores integer keys and data</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>size: 7</li>
                        <li>loadLimit: 0.5</li>
                        <li>mode: Linear probing</li>
                        <li>hash function: h(k)=k+1</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>With the provided print function, the current hash table looks like this:
                    <pre>
0: [Active]{6} | 1: [Active]{13} | 2: [Active]{1} | 3: [Empty] | 4: [Empty] | 5: [Empty] | 6: [Empty]</pre>
                    <p>Then, if we try to add another item {20,200} to it, the load limit will exceed as having 4 items
                        in total
                        is more than the loadLimit*m (0.5*7=3.5). Rehashing is needed.</p>
                    <p>We will insert the existing items {6,66}, {13,133}, and {1,11} to the expanded table, in that
                        order, as it is how they are ordered in the table Cell array as shown above.</p>
                    <p>That is, start with an empty table of double size (i.e. size=14):</p>
                    <pre>

                        together with BSTImplementation, HashTableImplementation, and Library.cpp. Run ./testN.exe to
                        run the program. See the Sample Output and Grading Scheme section for more information about the
                        test cases.

                    <p>
                        It is <strong>required</strong> that your submissions can be compiled and run successfully in
                        our online autograder ZINC. If we cannot even compile your work, it won't be graded. Therefore,
                        for parts that you cannot finish, just put in dummy implementation so that your whole program
                        can be compiled for ZINC to grade the other parts that you have done. Empty implementations can
                        be like:

                    <p>There will be a penalty of -1 point (out of a maximum 100 points) for
                        every minute you are late. For instance, since the deadline of the assignment is 23:59:00 on Dec
                        05th,
                        if you submit your solution at 1:00:00 on Dec 06th, there will be a

                        your

                        an assignment is zero: any negative score after the deduction due to late penalty (and any other

                    <br>

                    <p>Q: My code doesn't work / there is an error, here is the code. Can you help me fix it?</p>
                    <p>A: As the assignment is a major course assessment, to be fair, you are supposed to work on it on
                        your own and we should not finish the tasks for you. We might provide some very general hints to
                        you, but we shall not fix the problem or debug it for you.</p>

                    <br/>
                    <p>Q: Can I add extra helper functions?</p>
                    <p>A: You may do so in the files that you are allowed to modify and submit.</p>

                    <br/>
                    <p>Q: Can I include additional libraries?</p>
                    <p>A: No. Everything you need is already included - there is no need for you to add any include
                        statement (under our official environment).</p>

                    <br/>
                    <p>Q: What should be the key of Binary Search Tree Index (bstIndex) in Library.h/cpp?</p>
                    <p>A: The publishDate of LibraryItem will be the key of bstIndex. You need to convert
                        publishDate(int) to string and insert into bstIndex according to the publishDate(string).
                        You can use to_string(publishDate) to convert the integer value to string. The string library is
                        already included. So you do not need to include the string library again. Here is the code
                        example. You also can find more detail in <a
                                href="http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/string/to_string/"> cpp documentation </a>.
                    <pre>
<code>
// to_string example
std::string pi = "pi is " + std::to_string(3.1415926);
std::string perfect = std::to_string(1+2+4+7+14) + " is a perfect number";
std::cout << pi << '\n';
std::cout << perfect << '\n';
</code>
</pre>
                    </p>

                    <br/>
                    <p>Q: How to check memory leakage?</p>
                    <p>A: TA Wallace prepared this guideline:
                        <a href="assignment3/leak-checking/index.html"> https://course.cse.ust.hk/comp2012/assignments/assignment3/assignment3/leak-checking/</a></p>

                    <br/>
                    <p>Q: How to handle collision in rehashing?</p>
                    <p>A: The approach will be the same as add a new element. If you try m times and not successful, you
                        can skip that item without return -1 and continue for the next item.</p>

                    <br/>
                    <p>Q: Question of runtime checking?</p>
                    <p>A: We will use a large data size case to test the runtime, which doesn't pass the runtime test. I
                        will read the source code implementation of BST, HashTable get, insert, delete, and validate is
                        that exhaustive approach which maintaining runtime N for all(best, average, worst) situation.
                        (e.g. hashtable, rehashing case is a worst-case, it can exceed O(1) promise.)

                    <p>Q: Do Deep Copy copy the DELETED cell status?</p>
                    <p>A: You need to copy all cells, even the status is DELETED or EMPTY. For deleted cells, we
                        recommend you set the data address to nullptr in order to prevent abnormal behavior. Also, if
                        the cell is activate, you are required to allocated new memory for the active cell data.
                        <br>
                        Although isReferenceOnly == true may possibly result in memory leakage. Since we don't specify
                        that behavior, we will not test memory leakage in that situation.</p>

                                <p>Q: In BSTNode.h, the given BSTNode constructor's parameter value should be of type S instead of T, right?</p>
                                <p>A: Correct. That was a typo, sorry about that. However, even with T it would still work (our solution could compile with that as well) because the BSTNode.h is included inside of the BST class, so T is actually defined as the template parameter of BST. Since we would always use the same value type for the BST and BSTNode anyway, it would still work effectively the same. On the other hand, if one includes the BSTNode.h outside of the BST class, then type S must be used because T would be undefined then.
                                <br>To avoid confusion, the skeleton has been updated by replacing that T with S on that line at 9:50am of Apr 22th. If you have the old version, you can update the file if you want, but it is not technically necessary as the old version would still compile and work as explained.

                        takes the type T key as input. Hash Function h2 takes the type int collision count as input.
                        Hash Function h2 is only utilized when the collision resolving mode is double.</p>
