              <p>
                Let's try something different in this lab.
                <br><br>
                You will be given a class diagram, description of the classes, and a main.cpp that uses those classes. You will create the corresponding class header and source files yourself, to practice creating classes with basic inheritance from scratch.
              </p>

              <h4 id="description">Description</h4>
              <p>There are 4 classes in total:</p>
              <center><img src="img/classes.png"></center>
              <p>The top-level base class is Animal. Dog inherits from Animal while Corgi and GreatDane inherit from Dog.</p>

              <h3>Animal</h3>
              <p>You should declare the class in <b>animal.h</b> and define the member functions in <b>animal.cpp</b>. You can see that animal.h is included in main.cpp.</p>
              <p>It should have only one <u>private</u> data member <b>name</b> of the <b>string</b> type. It has no other data member.</p>
              <p>It has only one constructor <code>Animal(string name)</code> as you can see that is invoked in the main function. It simply sets the name of the animal upon construction of an animal object.</p>
              <p>It can <b>talk</b> and <b>eat</b>. (they are also invoked in the main function) We also are able to retrieve its name via the <b>getName</b> function. You need to determine their function headers yourself. Check the main.cpp to see how they are used, and derive what they need to output.</p>
              

              <h3>Dog</h3>
              <p>You should declare the class in <b>dog.h</b> and define the member functions in <b>dog.cpp</b>. You can see that dog.h is included in main.cpp.</p>
              <p>It should NOT have any data member defined in Dog itself. Of course, it should inherit <b>name</b> from the parent class.</p>
              <p>It has only one constructor <code>Dog(string name)</code> as you can see that is invoked in the main function. It simply sets the name of the dog upon construction of a dog object. You need to use the member initialization list (MIL) here.</p>
              <p>It can <b>talk</b>, <b>eat</b>, and <b>bark</b>. (they are also invoked in the main function) You need to determine their function headers yourself. Check the main.cpp to see how they are used, and derive what they need to output. <b>talk</b> and <b>eat</b> are already defined in the parent class, therefore, you need to define them again (i.e. override) in the Dog class to give them new implementations.</p>
              <p>Note: <b>getName</b> should not be defined in the Dog class itself - it should be inherited from the parent class.</p>

              <h3>Corgi</h3>
              <p>You should declare the class in <b>corgi.h</b> and define the member functions in <b>corgi.cpp</b>. You can see that corgi.h is included in main.cpp.</p>
              <p>It should NOT have any data member defined in Corgi itself. Of course, it should inherit <b>name</b> from the parent class.</p>
              <p>It has only one constructor <code>Corgi(string name)</code> as you can see that is invoked in the main function. It simply sets the name of the corgi upon construction of a Corgi object. You need to use the member initialization list (MIL) here.</p>
              <p>It can <b>talk</b>, <b>eat</b>, and <b>bark</b>. (they are also invoked in the main function) You need to determine their function headers yourself. Check the main.cpp to see how they are used, and derive what they need to output. <b>bark</b> is already defined in the parent class, therefore, you need to define it again (i.e. override) in the Corgi class to give it a new implementation.</p>
              <p>Note: <b>talk</b>, <b>eat</b>, and <b>getName</b> should not be defined in the Corgi class itself - it should be inherited from the parent class.</p>

              <h3>GreatDane</h3>
              <p>You should declare the class in <b>greatdane.h</b> and define the member functions in <b>greatdane.cpp</b>. You can see that greatdane.h is included in main.cpp.</p>
              <p>It should NOT have any data member defined in GreatDane itself. Of course, it should inherit <b>name</b> from the parent class.</p>
              <p>It has only one constructor <code>GreatDane(string name)</code> as you can see that is invoked in the main function. It simply sets the name of the greatdane upon construction of a GreatDane object. You need to use the member initialization list (MIL) here.</p>
              <p>It can <b>talk</b>, <b>eat</b>, and <b>bark</b>. (they are also invoked in the main function) You need to determine their function headers yourself. Check the main.cpp to see how they are used, and derive what they need to output. <b>bark</b> is already defined in the parent class, therefore, you need to define it again (i.e. override) in the GreatDane class to give it a new implementation.</p>
              <p>Note: <b>talk</b>, <b>eat</b>, and <b>getName</b> should not be defined in the GreatDane class itself - it should be inherited from the parent class.</p>

                  Download the <a href="main.cpp">main.cpp</a>. Note that your project contains several cpp files, so you need to use the command <code>g++ -std=c++11 -o programName *.cpp</code> to compile it just like the previous lab, or you can also create a Makefile yourself. To run it, execute <code>./programName</code> in terminal.
