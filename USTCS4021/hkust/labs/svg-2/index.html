    <span class="lab">COMP4021 Lab 4</span>
    <span class="title">SVG Platform Game</span>
  </h1>

  <h2>Overview</h2>

  <ul>
    <li>In this lab, you will start building your second project - SVG platform game</li>
    <li>Two files (game.html, game.js) are given to you as a starting point <a href="game.zip">here</a></li>
    <li>This lab project works in Mozilla Firefox and Chrome (no plugin required)</li>
    <li>You need to do these two tasks:
      <ol>
        <li><a href="index.html#platform">Adding platforms to the game</a></li>
        <li><a href="index.html#jump">Jump movement</a></li>
      </ol>
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h2>The Structure of the Game Files</h2>

  <ul>
    <li>This diagram shows the relationship between the two given files:
      <p><img src="images/file-structure.png" alt="File Structure" width="400" /></p>
    </li>

    <li>game.html
      <ul>
        <li>A simple HTML page that contains an SVG element and a reference to a JavaScript file</li>
		<li> Executes the load() function in game.js after the web page is loaded. </li>
		<li>The SVG element in game.html contains all the graphic components of the game. </li>
      </ul>
    </li>

    <li>game.js
      <ul>
        <li>A JavaScript file contains the code which defines the following:
          <ul>
            <li>Object properties</li>
            <li>Event handlers, i.e. <tt>load()</tt>, <tt>keydown(evt)</tt> and <tt>keyup(evt)</tt></li>
            <li>Functions used to control the behavior of the objects</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h2>The Structure of the SVG Element</h2>

  <ul>
    <li>The following figure shows the structure of the SVG element in game.html:
      <p><img src="images/dom_structure.png" alt="SVG Structure" /></p>
    </li>

    <li><tt>&lt;defs&gt;</tt>
      <ul>
        <li>It contains all definitions such as gradients and patterns</li>
      </ul>
    </li>

    <li><tt>&lt;g style="clip-path:url(#gameareaclip)"&gt;</tt>
      <ul>
        <li>It is the group element which contains the 'gamearea' group</li>
        <li>It is clipped by the clip path defined in the <tt>&lt;defs&gt;</tt> node</li>
        <li>It is clipped because we do not want to show the objects that lie outside the background</li>
      </ul>
    </li>

    <li><tt>&lt;g id="gamearea" .../&gt;</tt>
      <ul>
        <li>It is the group element which contains all the moving elements related to the game such as the player, the monsters, etc.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>

    <li><tt>&lt;g id="player"&gt;</tt>
      <ul>
        <li>The group is the element that represents the player in this game</li>
      </ul>
    </li>

    <li><tt>&lt;g id="platforms" .../&gt;</tt>
      <ul>
        <li>The platform group contains all the platforms in this game</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Task</h2>

  <ul>
    <li>After extracting the given <a href="game.zip">zip file</a>, you can start the game by double-clicking <tt>game.html</tt>
    <p>
    <a href="images/gui.png"><img src="images/gui_small.png" alt="The Game" /></a>
    <br />
    <span class="footnote">(Click to see the image in the original size)</span>
    </p>
    </li>
    <li>You can move the player (the smiley) around by pressing the "N" key for moving to the left and the "M" key for moving to the right</li>
    <li>You need to add two features to this system:
      <ol>
        <li>Platforms for the player to stand on</li>
        <li>The ability to press a key to make the player jump from one platform to another platform</li>
      </ol>
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h2><a name="platform"></a>1. Adding Platforms to the Game</h2>

  <ul>
      <li>Your first task is to add the platforms so that the player can stand on the platforms of the game</li>
      <li>To do this you can add rectangles to the <tt>gamearea</tt> using the <tt>rect</tt> SVG tag</li>
      <li>For example, you can use the following SVG code to add a red platform with the size of 100x20 at the position (20, 20):
      <pre>&lt;rect x="20" y="20" width="100" height="20" style="fill:red"/&gt;</pre>
      </li>
      <li>Because of the structure of the given JavaScript code your platforms' position and size must be a multiple of 20</li>
      <li>This ensures that the code for calculating the player movement can be simple</li>
      <li>You are free to add any platforms to your game as long as you follow the requirement above (position and size must be multiples of 20)</li>
      <li>Here is an example of platforms added to the game:
      <p>
      <a href="images/platforms.png"><img src="images/platforms_small.png" alt="Example platforms" /></a>
      <br />
      <span class="footnote">(Click to see the image in the original size)</span>
      </p>
      </li>
  </ul>

  <h2><a name="jump"></a>2. Jump Movement</h2>

  <ul>
      <li>After you add the platforms you will find that the player can only fall off a platform but cannot jump back on it</li>
      <li>We will add a jump action to the player so that the player can jump from one platform to another</li>
      <li>First, you need to select a key (any key) for controlling the jump movement of the player</li>
      <li>You can add another <tt>case</tt> statement in the <tt>keydown()</tt> function in <tt>game.js</tt></li>
      <li>For example, you can use the "Z" key to represent the jump action, as follows:
      <pre>function keydown(evt) {
    . . .
    switch (keyCode) {
        . . .
        case "Z".charCodeAt(0):
            . . .
    }
    . . .
}</pre>
    </li>
    <li>The code <tt>"Z".charCodeAt(0)</tt> returns the ASCII code of the character "Z"</li>
    <li>To make the player jump you need to add a vertical speed to the player object</li>
    <li>This can be done by assigning a <tt>JUMP_SPEED</tt> constant to the <tt>player.verticalSpeed</tt> variable</li>
    <li>This <tt>player.verticalSpeed</tt> variable is the current speed of the player in the vertical direction</li>
    <li>It is used to calculate the player movement in the <tt>gamePlay()</tt> function</li>
    <li>However you cannot always let the player jump in the game</li>
    <li>The player can only jump when he/she is standing on one of the platforms</li>
    <li>We can check whether the player is standing on a platform using the <tt>isOnPlatform()</tt> function of the player object, i.e.
    <pre>if (player.isOnPlatform()) {
    <span class="todo">Set the player vertical speed</span>
}
</pre>
    </li>
  </ul>
