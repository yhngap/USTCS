				<b>Instructional Approach</b>
				<br />
				The lectures will cover the basic textbook material.
				Lectures will not necessarily cover all of the indicated readings; so do not skip the readings.
				As a general principle, you will be responsible for the topics covered in the lectures and for
				assigned sections of the textbook. Because you are expected to take an active role in this course,
				you must come to each lecture prepared. Preparation means reading the assigned chapters <i>before</i>
				the lecture and identifying questions that you need answered. Preparation also means being willing
				to look up information that you need, for example, in the textbook, on the Web or in other resources.
				<br />
				<br />

				<a href="../Lectures/lecture-notes.html" target="mainFrame"><b>Lecture Notes and Videos</b></a>
				<br />
				Lecture notes and videos are available from Canvas or
				<a href="../index.html">https://course.cse.ust.hk/comp3311/</a>. <i style="color: red;"><b>Lecture notes are outlines only of the lecture material.</b></i>
				They are not a substitute for attending lectures or reading the indicated textbook chapters and
				should not be relied on solely for your knowledge of the course material.
				Most lectures will include exercises related to the lecture material.
				<i style="color: red;"><b>Doing the lecture exercises will form part of your course grade.</b></i>
			  <br />
				<br />
			</li>
			<li>
				<a href="../Tutorials/tutorial-schedule.html" target="mainFrame"><b>Tutorials</b></a>
				<br />
				The tutorials will be used primarily for practice exercises related to the course material.
				<i style="color: red;"><b>Doing the tutorial exercises will form part of your course grade.</b></i>
				<br />
				<br />
			</li>
			<li>
				<a href="../Labs/lab-schedule.html" target="mainFrame"><b>Labs</b></a>
				<br />
				The labs will be used for hands-on activities that allow you to learn how to use the various
				capabilities of the database management system used in the course project and to work on the course project.
				<i style="color: red;"><b>Doing the lab exercises will form part of your course grade.</b></i>
				When not used for specific instruction or activities, the labs are also a time during which you can work
				on the course project or consult with a TA about the course project or  other course material.
			  <br />
				<br />
			</li>
			<li>
				<a href="../Project/project-info.html" target="mainFrame"><b>Project</b></a>
				<br />
				The course project is an <i style="color: red;"><b>individual-effort project</b></i> with three tasks.
				The project description will be available after the third lecture of the semester and will be posted on the
				<a href="../Project/project-info.html" target="mainFrame">Project Information</a> course web page.
			  <br />
				<br />
			</li>
			<li>
				<a href="schedule.html" target="mainFrame"><b>Project Task/Test/Exam Dates</b></a>
				<br />
				The project task and test/exam <i style="color: red;"><b>dates are firm</b></i>
				and will not be changed unless exceptional circumstances arise.			    <i style="color: red;"><b>Late submission normally is not allowed.</b></i>
			  <br />
				<br />
			</li>
			<li>
				<a href="http://ugadmin.ust.hk/integrity/student-1.html" target="_blank"><b>Academic Integrity</b></a>
				<br />
				Unless otherwise stated, <i style="color: red;"><b>the work that you submit for grading must
				represent the result of individual, independent effort</b></i>.
				In particular, you are not allowed to give solutions to or to copy solutions
				from other students (past or present).
				Suspected breaches of this rule will be referred to the relevant university authorities for disciplinary action.
				<i style="color: red;"><b>If in doubt, consult with the instructor or TA first!</b></i>
				<br />
				<br />
			</li>
			<li>
				<b>Computer Account Security</b>
				<br />
				Do not share your computer account with anyone and always protect your CSE computer account password!
				<br />
				<br />
			</li>
			<li>
				<b>Classroom Etiquette</b>
				<br />
				The following rules are for the benefit of all to ensure that the classroom
				environment is conducive to teaching and learning.
			</li>

			<blockquote>
				<p>
					You are expected to arrive on time for lectures, tutorials and labs (as is the instructor/TA
					<img src="../images/smile.gif" width="13" height="13" align="bottom" />)
					and generally not to leave during a lecture, tutorial or lab unless an emergency arises.
					If you must leave during a lecture, tutorial or lab, please do so
					<i style="color: red;"><b>as discretely and quietly as possible</b></i>
					and with <i style="color: red;"><b>minimum disruption to the class</b></i>.
				</p>
				<p>
					<i style="color: red; text-decoration: underline;"><b>Talking is strictly prohibited
					during a lecture or tutorial</b></i> unless the instructor/TA asks you a question
					or directs you to discuss an exercise or work with other students on an exercise.
					To behave otherwise shows disrespect, not only for the instructor/TA, but also,
					and more importantly, for your fellow students.
				</p>
				<p>
					Please be considerate in your behavior and consider the possible effects of your actions on others.
				</p>
			</blockquote>
			<li>
				<b>Information Posted On The Course Web Pages</b>
				<br />
				The course web pages are constantly undergoing revision.
				No information on the course web pages is final until it has been confirmed in class.
