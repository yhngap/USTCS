			    which can be downloaded from <a href="https://www.oracle.com/tools/downloads/sqldev-downloads.html" target="_blank">https://www.oracle.com/tools/downloads/sqldev-downloads.html</a>.
			    It is free, but you are required to create an Oracle account to  download the software.
			    There are versions for Windows, Mac and Linux. The latest version is 20.2 and JDK 8 or 11 is required
			    to also be installed. If you have not already done so, you should also install the HKUST VPN software
			    from <a href="http://itsc.ust.hk/apps/vpn/" target="_blank">http://itsc.ust.hk/apps/vpn/</a> as it will be needed in the labs to access the department's Oracle

                  Your scanned exercise must be legible.
